Main commands:
  init          Prepare your working directory for other commands
  validate      Check whether the configuration is valid

  apply         Create or update infrastructure
  destroy       Destroy previously-created infrastructure
The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.
Whenever a configuration's backend changes, you must run terraform init again to validate and configure the backend before you can perform any plans, applies, or state operations. When changing backends, Terraform will give you the option to migrate your state to the new backend.
Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures. This state is stored by default in a local file named "terraform.
