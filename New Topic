Before pushing your code some other admin who is working on that pushed the code so your push gets rejected it shows there are updates and it doesn't allows us so we need to git pull before pushing
Diff b/w pull and clone=git pull is used to get updates complete repo is brought by git clone but pull brings the changes like adding files or changes made to files etc..
Best practise first use git pull before pushing
Git lifecycle ? ans: explain all the three stages
git clone=remote repo to local repo
git push=local repo to remote repo
for authentication between git and github we give personal access token which is available in settings-->developer settings-->personal access token
To do anything in git like commit we need to set global configuration by using git config --global user.name "name" and git config --global user.mail "email@gmail.com"
Branch=It is unique set of code changes & with unique name
git log = displays a record of the commits in a Git repository 
git status = The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area
All uncommited files are visible in all branches & after commit they belong to branch where we have commited.
git cherry-Pick is used to picking single commit from one branch to others.
When there are updates in both branches, merging of that both branches will open vi editor gets pop-up.We have a merge commit in git log.
How do you handle the merge conflicts? ans: need to fix the conflicts and then commit the result.
