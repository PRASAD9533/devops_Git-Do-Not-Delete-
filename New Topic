Before pushing your code some other admin who is working on that pushed the code so your push gets rejected it shows there are updates and it doesn't allows us so we need to git pull before pushing
Diff b/w pull and clone=git pull is used to get updates complete repo is brought by git clone but pull brings the changes like adding files or changes made to files etc..
Best practise first use git pull before pushing
