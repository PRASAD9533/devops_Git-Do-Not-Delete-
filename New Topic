Uses of Readme.md file
It helps to give long description of the project.
git is software installed local on system
github is web-based portal
git version 2.31.1.windows.1
git update (to update currnt version of git on local system)
Before pushing your code some other admin who is working on that pushed the code so your push gets rejected it shows there are updates and it doesn't allows us so we need to git pull before pushing
Diff b/w pull and clone=git pull is used to get updates complete repo is brought by git clone but pull brings the changes like adding files or changes made to files etc..
Best practise first use git pull before pushing
Git lifecycle ? ans: explain all the three stages
git clone=remote repo to local repo
git push=local repo to remote repo
for authentication between git and github we give personal access token which is available in developer settings
