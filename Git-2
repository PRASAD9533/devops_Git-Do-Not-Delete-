*********************************Git video 6 is very much important*************************
To undo commited changes use reset and revert
reset -- remove files and commit history. (three types of reset soft=commit history get removed, files sent from staging area mixed=commit history get removed files sent from working area hard=commit history get removed as well as removed from local repo)
revert -- remove files but not commit history
reset = commit id's above the selected commit will be removed
revert = selected commit will be removed
To undo uncommited changes use git checkout or restore (to undo changes in the working area or staging area)
to remove from staging to working git reset -<filename>
to remove from working directory git clean -i
if we have files in staging directory how to move them to working directory ---> git reset -- <filename>
I have the changes in uncommited file(working directory) want to remove changes not the file----> git chekout/restore --<file name>
I create a file in master branch and want to create new branch but don't want the source file in destination branch what to do? git stash
i have commited the file but commited incorrectly how to change the commit message ------> using amend
delete branch = git branch -D <branch name>
change the commit message of latest commit git commit --amend -m "message"
how to get back the content deleted by using revert and reset ----> git reflog <commit id of reseted file>
uncommited file is visible in all branches how to make invisble by using git stash. 
how to combine multiple commits ----> git merge --squash <destination branch>
git switch quick way of switching branch
to copy code from others github to our github------>fork
In realtime projects we do not push any updated code to main branch.(We have branch protection rule for main branch). settings --> branch --> new protection rule
to push non main branch we need to create or compare and pull request then approver should approve it.
create pull request when we want to merge our code to main repo after creating invite collaborator aprrover should approve it.
Fetch only brings the content but it does not merge.
git pull = fetch + merge
rebase is equal to merge but Firstly Rebase takes destination commits later it gives its own commits.
Head always points out to the latest commit.
diff shows difference between the commits.
tags are similar to branches but we can't change like we do in branches
